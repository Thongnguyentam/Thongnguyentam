# Hello! üëã I'm Dylan Nguyen

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a Computer Science and Data Science student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems.

### About Me
I‚Äôm a problem solver, hacker, and tech enthusiast, always striving to learn and create. My journey started in 2021 when I wrote my first line of code. Since then, I‚Äôve dived into full-stack development, AI/ML, cloud computing, and blockchain technologies, with a strong focus on scalable infrastructure and MLOps.

### üéØ Currently Focused On:
- **Automating MLOps workflows** for deployment, monitoring, and scaling AI systems
- **Exploring Network Security, Agentic AI, and Computer Vision** through self-study
- **Automating processes** and solving complex problems in my personal projects

### üí° Fun Facts:
- üèÜ **6 hackathon wins**, including Second Place at One Trillion Agents hackathon, Best Agent Overall at Sonic DeFAI hackathon.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Hands-on with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes) and MLOps stacks (MLflow, Kubeflow, KServe, Prometheus, Grafana).
- ü§ñ When I'm not coding, I attend tech conference, or experiment with the latest AI models.
- üåê I'm passionate about making a **positive social impact** through technology.

### üèÜ Achievements:
- **2nd Place** at One Trillion Agents Hackathon
- **Honorable Mention Best Agents Overall** at Sonic DEFAI Hackathon
- **2nd PLace** at Degen Track at SUI Overflow Hackathon
  
Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate, chat tech, or swap hackathon stories!
